<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Sports Photography</h2>
<p>My sports photography journey began back in January 2021.</p>
<p>After a major hip injury resulted in reconstructive surgery, I was told I was going to have to step away from the track for at least six months. It was during this time when i first began my photogrpahy career and have been working hard loving every moment since!</p>
<p>In January of 2023 I shifted my work towards freelance options and have since began working for various sports teams at a varity of Division I schools.</p>
<p>The schools I have freelanced for are as followed:</p>

<ol>
    <li>South Carolina, Baseball</li>
    <li>Mississippi State, Track and Field</li>
    <li>Georgia, Equestrian</li>
    <li>Miami, Baseball</li>
    <li>Monmouth, Track and Field</li>
    <li>Furman, Women's Lacrosse</li>
    <li>Toledo, Men's Basketball</li>
<ol>
